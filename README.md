# nwTWM
A simple tiling window manager inspired from the great dwm(https://dwm.suckless.org), except a little less random features and more geared towards simplicity and elegance. This is still in alpha stage.

# TODO
- Make the main window manager
- Add a special status bar for itself
- A lot of things not decided yet :P
